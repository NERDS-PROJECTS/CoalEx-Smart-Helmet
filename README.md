# CoalEx-Smart-Helmet
The mining industry is known worldwide for its highly risky and hazardous working environment. Research so far in the area of safety has revealed that the majority of incidents in this hazardous industry take place because of human error, the control of which would enhance safety levels in working sites. 
Mining workers are affected by many hazards – from ventilation problems, mine flooding, gas explosions, ceiling collapsing, mine haulage, sudden inrushes and mine inundation, spontaneous combustion, to un-optimized evacuation routes. There is no exact solution that can forecast these risks and avoid them even before they occur.
# DEPENDANCY ON COAL
About three-fourth of India’s electricity is coal-based, its dependence on coal is growing faster than any other country in the world (6% a year) and coal extraction has doubled to 500 million tons since 1994. It’s killing people.
* **DEATH OF MINERS**
   * **377** coal miners have died in the last 3 years. 159 deaths ocurred in 2020 alone.
# PROPOSED WORKING SYSTEM
To design an IOT enabled smart suit and a headgear for coal mine workers with sensors enabled from which data shall be transmitted by an wireless technology to the head of the mine though a server side user friendly website along with an alert mechanism to worker and his manager if there is any anomaly in the working conditions.
